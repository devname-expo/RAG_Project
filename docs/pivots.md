# PDF Processing Project - Pivot Tracking Document

## Technical Pivots and Resolution Status

### Pivot 1: API Gateway Architecture Limitation
**Issue:** Design architecture revealed potential scalability constraints with API Gateway timeout thresholds for large PDF processing
**Solution:** Architect presigned URL implementation for direct S3 upload pathway
**Status:** Discontinued - Authentication blockers led to alternative approach (see Pivot 2)

### Pivot 2: S3 Authentication Challenge
**Issue:** Authentication failures (403 Forbidden) encountered during presigned URL implementation
**Solution:** Implement interim solution utilizing manual Lambda triggers for S3 ingestion
**Status:** Deprioritized at decision checkpoint

### Pivot 3: Strategic Architecture Shift
**Issue:** Project velocity impacted by complexity of Hugging Face platform for Plan B
**Solution:** Continue with Plan A, but with simplified architecture. Develop local Proof of Concept leveraging Gemini + Pinecone RAG architecture.
**Status:** Completed successfully - Full POC functionality achieved

### Pivot 4: Production Implementation
**Issue:** Time-constrained productization of POC architecture (24-hour delivery window)
**Solution:** Parallel implementation of Inference Lambda service and local processing pipeline
**Status:** In progress - Architecture deployment phase
